    A parser for the opening_hours fields from OpenStreetMap.
    
    Provides Day objects, containing (among others) datetime.time objects
    representing the beginning and the end of all the opening periods.
    Can handle solar hours with "sunrise" or "sunset", including with
    offset like "(sunrise+02:00)".
    
    Automatically sanitizes the fields to prevent some common mistakes.
